# Base_R_Image_Recoginization_and_Prediction
## This project is for self learning purpose where I have tried to make a model that can predict the Personal images
### Steps: Renaming images to x and y. Total 6 images of x and 6 of y for training model. 
### [Here you can see the project on Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/amitbhsingh/406342)
### This project is inspired from the youtube video hosted by Bharatendra Rai
# _Result: Using RNN I was able to predict with 100 percent accuracy._
